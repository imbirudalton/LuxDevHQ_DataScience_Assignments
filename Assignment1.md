### Project Title
**Jumia Product Performance Dashboard: Analyzing Pricing, Discounts, and Customer Reviews**

---

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and build an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes the performance of products listed on Jumia. Students will explore how pricing, discounts, reviews, and ratings influence product performance and customer engagement.  

The final dashboard should support data-driven decision-making in an e-commerce context.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains product-level data with the following columns:

- **Product** – Name of the product  
- **Current Price** – Current selling price in Kenyan Shillings (KSh)  
- **Old Price** – Original price before discount in Kenyan Shillings (KSh)  
- **Discount** – Discount percentage applied to the product  
- **Reviews** – Number of customer reviews  
- **Rating** – Average customer rating out of 5  

---

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Check for and handle missing values, especially in the **Reviews** and **Rating** columns  
- Identify and remove duplicate product entries  
- Convert price columns into numeric format by removing “KSh” (use *Text to Columns* under Data tab), commas, and text or use *Find and Replace (Ctrl + H)*  
- Ensure the **Discount** column is numeric and properly formatted as a percentage (use *Find and Replace*, `LEFT/RIGHT` functions, or *Text to Columns*)  
- Convert the **Rating** column from text format (e.g., “4.5 out of 5”) into numeric values  
- Convert negative reviews to positive  

---

## Data Enrichment
Create the following additional columns:

- **Discount Amount (KSh):** Old Price minus Current Price  

- **Rating Category:**
  - *Poor* for ratings below 3  
  - *Average* for ratings between 3 and 4.4  
  - *Excellent* for ratings of 4.5 and above  

- **Discount Category:**
  - *Low Discount* for discounts below 20%  
  - *Medium Discount* for discounts between 20% and 40%  
  - *High Discount* for discounts above 40%

## Data Analysis

### Descriptive Analysis
- What is the average current price, old price, discount percentage, and rating?  
- Which product is the most expensive and which is the least expensive?  
- What is the average rating and discount by discount category?  
- How are products distributed across rating categories?  

### Trend and Relationship Analysis
- Analyze the relationship between discount percentage and number of reviews  
- Analyze the relationship between rating and number of reviews  
- Determine whether higher discounts lead to increased customer engagement  
- Determine whether higher-rated products tend to have more reviews  

### Product Performance Analysis
- Identify the top 10 products with the highest discounts  
- Identify the top 10 products with the most reviews  
- Identify the top 5 highest-rated and bottom 5 lowest-rated products  
- Compare high-discount and low-discount products based on average rating and number of reviews
